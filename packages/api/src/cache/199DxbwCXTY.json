  "transcript": "2.28:  60 minutes over time.\n5.6:  When you say concert, it doesn't really begin to describe a pink performance.\n14.24:  It is Broadway. It is raw.\n20.76:  It is served as so late.\n22.48:  It is flipping and Afrorats.\n27.18:  It is really amazing singing. It is a spectacle.\n33.86:  This week on 60 minutes we interview the singer Pink.\n40.0:  Pink is not just a singer. She is an acrobat. She is someone who trained in childhood gymnastics.\n50.68:  She is hanging from silk ropes and singing upside down.\n58.36:  All of this without safety nets.\n63.84:  When we were at Pink's house in Southern California,\n69.85:  she had this rig for lack of a better word.\n75.46:  She was doing a training session with her Arialist coach,\n78.32:  Dreah Weber and her Arialist partner, Kassan Brailsford.\n82.16:  Dreah Weber is her coach on how to do all of these aerial things.\n86.54:  These acrobatic things that Pink does and her shows hanging from these silk ropes.\n90.98:  You were afraid of heights and decided to get up and do this in your shows?\n94.42:  She just put me up there.\n95.8:  She is safety first for sure. She is the absolute best teacher.\n100.1:  But I always say that Dreah changed my life in many ways because back then I was rock and roll.\n106.32:  Janice Joplin, I am going to have a whiskey on stage and Dreah.\n110.78:  Dreah was like if I teach you this, if I pass this on to you,\n115.12:  you can never ever drink again before a show.\n118.12:  You can never ever ever never think about what you do and respect it for the craft that it is.\n123.76:  So walk me through your routine right now.\n127.02:  So after the show, one of the first things Pink does when she gets off of one of her concerts is she gets into an ice bath.\n134.26:  It's a cold plunge. This one was 40 something degrees. I mean, freezing cold.\n139.12:  It's midnight. She's exhausted. She's sweating. She just got off the show.\n143.42:  And the first thing she does is get in this ice bath.\n145.84:  Oh, God.\n148.5:  Oh, I hate it so much.\n149.69:  She says that it helps her the next day. It helps with recovery.\n155.42:  Oh my God.\n156.09:  This is something that NFL players do, but it just speaks to the athlete that she is.\n161.42:  And the maintenance that she's got to do to her body to be able to keep up with these concerts.\n165.68:  Okay, well, you're up.\n167.02:  Pink's daughter Willow ended up getting in the ice bath after her mom and there are really competitive family.\n171.64:  So Willow, the 12-year-old daughter, was trying to beat her mom's six-minute, seven-second time in the ice bath.\n179.76:  There you go.\n180.38:  Yeah, what is your number, is that?\n183.48:  Six-silly.\n184.18:  Oh, wow.\n185.02:  You made it.\n185.51:  And she just barely beat her.\n188.88:  Good job.\n189.88:  Thanks, friends. That was great.\n191.48:  Willow challenged her dad, carry heart, to get in.\n194.16:  And this motocrossed R. Who was a famous daredevil couldn't hang in comparison to his daughter.\n200.34:  Who he looked at his face.\n203.98:  She was candid and frank and honest and raw and didn't hold back and true to her reputation pretty much told it like it is.\n214.28:  You've been really open in talking about therapy.\n216.6:  Mm-hmm.\n217.53:  What are some of the conclusions that you've come to after all the therapy you've done about yourself your life, where you're headed, where you've been?\n225.04:  I am a person that really wants my blind spots pointed out.\n230.0:  I never want to not be aware of how I'm making the people that I care about feel.\n236.24:  I never want to become bitter.\n237.96:  I never want to be jaded.\n239.38:  I don't want to be unhealthy.\n240.61:  I don't want to be.\n242.7:  I don't want to keep all these feelings locked inside.\n245.02:  That's why I write songs.\n246.72:  I write poetry.\n248.86:  And I go to therapy because it's a really crazy world that we live in.\n252.92:  It's nuts and it's a lot to process.\n255.6:  I asked her husband, carry heart.\n257.0:  It's like to be married to someone who's so frank and forthcoming, including someone who writes about their marriage and has no problems putting it in their song.\n266.4:  Instead of studying her music and really learning her songs and even just talking with her as we did it your guys house.\n272.76:  I'm amazed at how much she's willing to put herself out there.\n276.22:  It just seems like there's no limit to any of that.\n279.22:  What's that like on your end?\n281.02:  Given how much she puts out there, even in terms of you guys in your marriage.\n285.24:  It's just the type of people that we are.\n287.08:  You know, when I see her on stage, backstage, at home in a PTA meeting, her in our kitchen like she's the same person.\n294.56:  She's her, I'm me.\n296.04:  And it's just her lifestyle.\n297.04:  Does any of the stuff that she puts out there ever bother you?\n300.06:  No, I have extremely thick skin.\n301.59:  I appreciate that honesty.\n303.28:  I mean, like we're people in the public eye and I think the message that we put out there is helpful to people.\n307.8:  Like we're not, we don't have this facade of everything's perfect and you know, look at us we're in a glass house.\n312.44:  What's she going to be like career wise in 20 years and 30 years and 40 years?\n317.34:  She's still going to be doing this hanging from these these things.\n320.12:  Where's this go?\n321.08:  I mean, I think the thing for her is it's it's the itch that you have to continue to scratch.\n325.04:  Like I've long exceeded my shelf life, but I still do it because I love it.\n328.52:  She is always going to do this because she loves it.\n331.21:  She takes really good care of herself and she's strong and she's determined.\n334.74:  So I wouldn't be surprised to see her with silver hair at 70s,\n337.44:  spending from the rafters in the ceiling.\n339.16:  I mean, it wouldn't be a shocking thing, but you know, I mean, it's really up to her.",
