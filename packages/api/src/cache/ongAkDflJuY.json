  "transcript": "2.28:  60 minutes over time.\n5.8:  For this week's 60 minutes, we talked to General Mark Milley, who stepped down last month\n10.53:  as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs' staff.\n13.24:  We spoke to him on the USS Constitution, the venerated Naval frigate that was first launched\n18.84:  in 1797, just months after George Washington stepped down as president.\n25.24:  The nickname to old iron sides, it is the oldest naval warships still afloat.\n30.1:  As we sat on the deck surrounded by America's military past, we asked General Milley about\n35.73:  its future.\n36.76:  He told us that advanced technologies like robotics and artificial intelligence will\n41.84:  rapidly change the character of war.\n44.9:  And because every country will have access to these technologies, the U.S. must be prepared.\n51.56:  Our military is going to have to change if we are going to continue to be superior to\n57.07:  every other military on Earth.\n58.58:  And it's true that the degree of strength, that military strength, and the willingness to use it\n63.26:  that I think you maintain that international order and that you maintain the peace.\n67.88:  There have been several periods in history that have transformed military operations or armed warfare.\n73.98:  Where does artificial intelligence sit in there?\n76.46:  That's huge.\n77.06:  In fact, I've referred to it as a mother of all technologies for the things.\n81.16:  So the ability to make decisions, so called Uta Loop, the Zervoyant Direct and Act Loop,\n86.14:  to do that fastening your opponent, oftentimes not always, but oftentimes gives you a decisive\n91.2:  advantage.\n92.34:  So Napoleon would oftentimes wake up at two in the morning to issue his orders to his\n95.38:  marshals and they'd be on the move before the British woke up for tea.\n98.96:  And if you think about the German operational doctrine of Blitzkrieg, that's what that\n105.61:  did.\n106.68:  But the artificial intelligence allows you to absorb massive amounts of complex information\n111.66:  very rapidly to assist humans in their decision making.\n115.8:  And theoretically, you can actually program the computers to make the decisions themselves,\n120.0:  which would be a whole new world at that point.\n122.58:  As of now, the Department of Defense guidelines say fully autonomous weapon systems must\n127.98:  allow commanders and operators to exercise appropriate levels of human judgment over the\n133.63:  use of force.\n135.2:  Those standards will apply to a new defense program called Replycator, a Pentagon initiative\n141.46:  aimed at countering the size of China's military.\n144.96:  The program will produce thousands of autonomous weapon systems powered by artificial intelligence.\n151.54:  The international committee of the Red Cross says autonomous weapons, including those that\n155.96:  use AI, could lead to unintended consequences, like civilian casualties or an escalation\n163.66:  of conflict.\n165.32:  Does it make war more likely?\n167.48:  It could.\n168.06:  It actually could.\n169.34:  So artificial intelligence has a huge amount of legal, ethical and moral implications\n175.0:  that we're just beginning to start to come to grips with.\n177.0:  Well, there's no chain of command and artificial intelligence is there.\n180.86:  Well, there might not be.\n183.84:  You know, artificial intelligence theoretically, they're taken to it its extreme.\n187.58:  Machines could be making decisions without human interface.\n192.12:  It could be a very, very dangerous thing, extremely dangerous.\n194.96:  Right now, the Department of Defense standard is for all decision-making to have a human\n199.9:  in a loop for better or worse.\n203.14:  But other countries may not have that same sense.\n206.64:  So artificial intelligence is extremely powerful.\n209.26:  It's coming at us.\n210.17:  I suspect it will be probably optimized for command and control of military operations within\n215.2:  maybe 10 to 15 years max.\n217.6:  And then you combine that with robotics.\n219.44:  You're probably looking at something like a third of sophisticated militarys, United\n224.25:  States, Russian, China, etc.\n226.12:  Maybe a third or 20 percent will likely be robotic in maybe 15 years or so.\n230.97:  So you're going to go from, you know, the USS Constitution, the ships of sale up to the\n235.31:  Nimmets aircraft carrier in the span of 15 years.\n238.42:  So it's a pretty, pretty fundamental change.\n241.42:  It's about to take place.",
