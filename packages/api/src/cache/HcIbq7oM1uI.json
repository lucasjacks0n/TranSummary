{"transcript": "2.3:  60 minutes over time.\n8.34:  This week on 60 minutes we go to Paris to see first-hand the restoration of the Cathedral\n13.98:  of Notre Dame.\n15.94:  Almost exactly four years ago, Notre Dame caught fire.\n22.3:  And what caught the attention of the world was when that iconic spire, a top-of-the-cathedral\n29.8:  collapsed.\n33.74:  When it collapsed, you could hear an audible gasp from people in Paris.\n39.24:  I remember the scream of the crowd saying, no, as if they couldn't conceive such a thing.\n48.92:  And that spire, it sort of represents the cathedral, it's iconic.\n54.6:  So when it fell, it was a shock-filled around the world.\n58.62:  In working on this story, I was surprised to learn that that spire was not an original\n65.34:  part of the Cathedral of Notre Dame.\n67.72:  At the beginning of the 1800s, the cathedral had fallen into disrepair.\n74.18:  We spoke to journalist and author Ania's Poly-A.\n78.8:  Victor Hugo is the reason why she's still standing, really.\n82.54:  Explain that to me.\n84.24:  Victor Hugo, we're in July 1830.\n88.18:  Promises publisher a big, big novel.\n91.26:  Then the revolution of July 1830 break out, which it's barricades, etc.\n97.4:  And he writes and writes and he invent all those characters that are so familiar to us,\n104.54:  still, you know, quasi-modeau, is Merrell there.\n107.38:  And he may not have known only a world here in through his novel.\n111.8:  But he was also responsible for the creation of the ministry responsible for historical\n118.92:  monuments and national heritage.\n121.42:  Victor Hugo.\n121.98:  Victor Hugo.\n123.36:  A few years before writing the hunt back up, Matodam, he wrote a pamphlet called\n128.34:  War on the demolishes.\n130.92:  And at the time there was no law to preserve heritage.\n135.62:  And he said, there are two things about a building.\n138.0:  It's use and its beauty.\n139.96:  It's use belongs to the owner, the beauty belongs to everyone.\n144.14:  And to destroy its beauty is to exceed one's rights.\n147.86:  After the book, there was this outpouring.\n151.48:  People wanted to preserve the cathedral.\n154.98:  People wanted to see the cathedral.\n156.42:  People wanted to see the cathedral reborn.\n159.52:  The French government at the time hired a young architect named Violet Luduc.\n165.24:  Violet Luduc was rebellious.\n167.02:  He didn't want to be trained the way architects were trained at the time going through\n171.59:  the Buzard.\n173.18:  And what it did was for years, it walked throughout France and throughout Europe just\n179.79:  catching.\n180.74:  Every time you would see a medieval ruin or a medieval church, it would sketched every detail.\n186.76:  And he restored, nodured onto its former glory and invented that spire.\n192.08:  Violet Luduc put up the spire.\n194.56:  And it was as if that spire had been there all along.\n199.28:  There were 16 statues, 12 of the disciples and four of evangelists that Violet Luduc had\n207.73:  crafted and placed on the spire.\n211.16:  They went up the sides of the spire.\n217.08:  And then they were in a very natural way.\n218.38:  And they were in a very natural way.\n221.68:  And they were in a very natural way.\n224.76:  And they were in a very natural way.\n225.22:  And they were in a very natural way.\n227.86:  And they were in
