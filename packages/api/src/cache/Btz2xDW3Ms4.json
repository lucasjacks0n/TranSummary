  "transcript": "1.02:  Hey, I thought I'd share with you a way to integrate Monday.com with Slack a little bit better\n7.82:  than what is offered as the standard integration. So I do offer an integration which is quite\n13.18:  nice, but you may find yourself in a situation where you need something a little bit better.\n18.6:  So this is a scenario I've just been working on for a client. And we've got when a task is actually\n27.0:  a client to a person, we want to know to file that user in Slack. But the problem is you can't select\n33.58:  that user dynamically. You can select any user in your Slack channel, but you can't have it be the exact same\n41.58:  person who you assign the task to. It's a single person that you select from a list that every time\n47.5:  is going to get assigned to that task. So how do you get around this? Well, you can use a make.com scenario.\n54.0:  So what we've got here is actually, well, when you watch the boards column value, it will actually create\n60.08:  its own webbook, which is great. It just sets it up in the back end, puts it into Monday.com.\n65.88:  It's actually a really nice integration. And so we've just named it when the social board person is updated\n73.44:  that will then fire this. It runs immediately as data rise because we're using web hooks. So there's no delay on this.\n80.0:  And then using Monday.com to get the user. And you'll see there's two modules here to get the user.\n86.61:  The first is who the new person has been the task has been assigned to. And then the second one is who\n94.52:  it's been assigned by. So I might log into Monday.com and assign the task to someone. I'd like to know both who I'm assigning\n102.0:  to and who's been who it's been assigned by. We then actually get the email address from that user in both of these situations.\n113.28:  And we then find that user in Slack. So in Slack, we're only searching for the user who the task has been assigned to.\n119.98:  And caveat us both, this does only work if the user in Monday.com and Slack has the same email address.\n129.12:  But if you're an organization that set this up, you're using with an organization email address, your users should have the same email address.\n138.96:  That works really nicely. We then searching for that user in Slack. And we do that by the email address as you can see there.\n148.4:  And then the last part is to pop it into a channel. We've got a private channel here.\n154.4:  You add sign in these brackets. The add sign, the user ID. That's how you can actually tag that user.\n163.84:  Post name is the name of the item in Monday. And then you can see here has been assigned to you by 15 name.\n172.68:  So 15 is this module over here who it's been assigned by. So I think this is a great little use case of how you can expand on the custom integration that\n183.6:  Monday and Slack offers. But something a bit more personalized, a bit more customizable. Again, from here you can expand. You can send an email to that person to let them know.\n195.3:  You can send them a text message to let them know. You can run different filters to identify if it's an urgent request.\n201.62:  It's been marked as urgent. Then you can again further just increase the scenario and scale it out.\n210.0:  So hopefully you enjoyed this. This is part of the automation challenge. If you've got an automation that you would like me to have a look at, let me know in the comments.\n217.5:  This is something that I love doing. So I'm happy to help. So drop it in the comments and look forward to seeing you tomorrow for the next part of our automation challenge.",
