{"transcript": "2.28:  60 minutes over time.\n6.96:  This week on 60 minutes, we traveled to a war zone in northwest Syria, a part of Syria\n12.48:  that's been fighting a civil war for a dozen years now.\n16.66:  Tragedically, it was also not far from the epicenter of the earthquakes that happened\n22.73:  in February.\n26.92:  We were there weeks after the earthquake occurred.\n30.28:  And once we got into northwest Syria, you could see immediately the incredible devastation.\n37.96:  Towns and cities that we were in, you would see one building standing and the next\n44.0:  five or six story of part-time building just rubble in the street.\n51.74:  We were in the middle of the war zone, but we were in the middle of the war zone.\n58.02:  We were in the middle of the war zone.\n63.08:  We were in the middle of the war zone, but we were not allowed to go to the war zone.\n69.88:  We were allowed to go to the war zone, and we were allowed to go to the war zone.\n77.14:  Right at Al-Salei is a remarkable individual.\n80.7:  He was an electrical contractor in Syria.\n83.6:  But when the Assad dictatorship and then later the Russians began devastating city after city,\n93.58:  began aerial bombardment of apartment buildings,\n96.94:  shelling of apartment buildings.\n99.08:  He found himself wanting to rescue those people.\n104.5:  One thing led to another, and ultimately they created the White Helmets,\n109.96:  one of the bravest organizations that I have ever had the pleasure to see working in a situation like this.\n118.98:  How did the White Helmets respond to the earthquake?\n121.88:  The war was not the case, but the war was not the case.\n126.64:  The war was not the case, but the war was not the case.\n131.72:  It was the war that we were in.\n135.62:  The war was not the case.\n138.2:  It was the war that we were in.\n140.44:  One woman told us that when her home began to shake and then began to collapse,\n147.76:  she assumed that it was a Russian air strike.\n150.54:  You have to keep in mind that these are people who had already been suffering\n156.32:  under a 12 year civil war.\n159.06:  It was just another air strike until the enormity of what had happened finally\n164.18:  dawned on all of them.\n165.94:  What do you remember of the moment that you were rescued by the White Helmets?\n171.7:  I was born in my zone.\n174.92:  I was born in my home.\n178.7:  I was born in the early days of the war.\n181.44:  I was born in the early days of the war.\n186.56:  I was born in the early days of the war.\n187.72:  I was born in the early days of the war.\n189.94:  I was born in the early days of the war.\n192.4:  When we first met the White Helmets, it was sort of a loosely organized group of volunteers.\n198.16:  The only thing they seemed to have joining them was the color of their helmets.\n202.64:  But now, after the earthquake, the White Helmets have a much bigger mission.\n207.44:  Not only are they trying to recover bodies at this point in all this rubble, but they are taking on the task in northwest Syria\n216.4:  of removing all of this rubble.\n218.64:  Pushing all of this debris out of the street so that people can get around again and finally try to help.\n226.02:  All of these people recover the remains of the loved ones that they've lost.\n231.08:  What remains to be done by your teams?\n234.52:  I don't know why.\n236.12:  I've been in the early days of the war.\n238.34:  I don't know why.\n240.44:  I don't know why.\n241.94:  I don't know why.\n244.96:  I don't know why.\n246.3:  I don't know
