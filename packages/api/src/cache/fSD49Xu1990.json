  "transcript": "2.6:  60 minutes over time.\n5.54:  We cannot win against the climate crisis.\n11.14:  Each country working on its own impossible.\n13.9:  Last year, 2022, we have seen climate disasters on all continents.\n21.24:  This has never happened before.\n23.32:  This week on 60 minutes, we interviewed Christelina Georgieva,\n28.02:  the managing director of the International Monetary Fund.\n32.02:  As an environmental economist, she brought climate issues\n35.7:  to the forefront of economic policy.\n39.12:  Last year, we have adopted the climate strategy for the IMF,\n43.54:  that says at the time when climate shocks are more and more severe\n49.64:  and the opportunity of the green transition offers a chance for countries\n56.14:  to create good jobs in renewable energy, in sustainable agriculture.\n62.62:  The IMF has to integrate climate considerations in our policies,\n67.98:  and we do so.\n69.76:  Should the IMF have a policy that its loans are contingent on countries having green policies?\n79.1:  We look at each country on its own in different countries that are different priorities.\n89.18:  So we do bring conditions for good stewardship of the economy\n96.52:  that sometimes include climate, water, resilience of the agriculture\n106.7:  for the benefit of the country.\n109.14:  Will you restructure loans for countries that have faced an environmental disaster?\n116.9:  Drown, severe floods.\n119.4:  What we do in these cases, we can provide additional financing for the country\n125.2:  to go through this very difficult period of time.\n128.32:  As a climate economist, talk to us about water.\n133.3:  And some minds, water is at the crux of the world's problem.\n137.68:  When we think of water in the future, we would be faced with too little, not enough, and too much.\n146.18:  75% of disasters are actually related to water, a recognition that access to water is paramount,\n156.0:  and yet nearly 800 million people don't have access to drinking water.\n161.94:  800 million people can drink million people.\n164.42:  And then we have the whole problem of waste water.\n169.7:  So little of it is treated in the developing world that it becomes a major health hazard.\n177.9:  The same way we are horrified that children die from hunger, we ought to be horrified children dying from diarrhea, because of dirty water.\n188.84:  Does the IMF do anything? Can the IMF do?\n192.12:  What we do is in countries where water waste, especially in agriculture, is a major problem,\n201.02:  we work on policies that would make water more valuable by removing some of this subsidies,\n211.1:  and making respect for water as a source of life, a part of economic policy.\n216.18:  Well, explain that, you're removing subsidies to farmers when we're talking about hunger.\n224.34:  And why does that make sense?\n225.76:  It makes sense because today they are water-used techniques that allow with very little water to produce the same quantity of food.\n238.16:  We are saying use agricultural research and support farmers move the subsidy from water waste free to making good use of water,\n252.62:  same money with a different objective.",
