  "transcript": "3.02:  Twitter has been instrumental in American politics and elections.\n7.14:  What role do you think ex will play in the 2020-24 U.S. elections?\n12.2:  Well, our goal is to be as even handed and far as possible, whether some is right left,\n17.58:  independent, whatever the case may be, that the platform is as parent and as much of a level\n26.38:  thing we all just possible.\n28.1:  And on the past Twitter has not been, Twitter was controlled by a far left activist,\n33.08:  but objectively, they would describe themselves to that.\n39.74:  So, you know, so, if someone has people like all has moved to the right, well, it's\n42.7:  moved to the center, so from the perspective of the far left, yes, it has moved to the\n46.38:  right, because everything is to the right from the far left.\n49.82:  But no one in the far left that I'm aware of has been suspended or being abandoned or\n53.45:  deamplified.\n55.52:  So, you know, but we're trying to be inclusive for the whole country and for the countries\n60.66:  too.\n62.4:  So, this is a diversity of viewpoints and free speech only matters if people you don't\n67.99:  like are allowed to say things you don't like, because if that's not the case, you don't\n73.34:  have free speech, and it's only a matter of time before the censorship just turned upon\n77.43:  you.\n78.5:  Do you think Donald Trump will come back to the platform?\n81.52:  You recently posted on to the social about this podcast.\n86.42:  Do you think truth post social is a funny name?\n90.54:  You know, every time you post on true social, that's the truth.\n94.32:  Yes.\n95.08:  Every time, like 100%.\n96.56:  Like, like, the symposium of the lie.\n98.42:  It's social.\n99.46:  I just find to find that every single thing is a truth.\n105.08:  Like, 100%.\n106.86:  Yeah.\n107.48:  That seems unlikely.\n108.56:  I think, girl, we'll say something about that.\n110.64:  There's some mathematical contradictions possible of everything that's a truth.\n114.9:  Do you think you'll come back to X and start posting there?\n119.6:  I mean, I think he owns a big part of truth.\n125.22:  So, truth social.\n125.49:  Yeah, truth social.\n126.68:  That's true.\n127.42:  It's a concept.\n128.34:  Yeah, truth, that's true.\n131.84:  It's a big part of truth social.\n132.38:  I think Donald Trump, I think he owns a big part of truth social.\n139.44:  So, you know, if he does want to post on the X platform, we would allow that.\n144.22:  You know, we obviously must allow presidential candidates to post on a platform.\n148.3:  Community knows might be really fascinating there.\n150.99:  The interactivity notes is awesome.\n153.28:  That's hope it holds up.\n156.02:  Yeah.\n156.54:  Again, in the political climate, we're so divisive and so, and so many intensely viral posts.\n163.44:  Community knows as like, it seems like a central breath of fresh air.\n168.52:  Yeah, it's great.\n170.36:  In fact, I mean, no system is going to be perfect, but the badny average of\n175.12:  the community notes is incredibly good.\n179.1:  I've actually frankly yet to see an incorrect note that's about more than if you are.\n183.24:  How do you explain why it works?\n185.64:  Yeah, so the magic of community notes is it requires people who have historically\n191.62:  disagreed in how they've rated notes.\n196.88:  In order to write a note, you know, you have to rate many notes.\n205.08:  And so we actually use AI here.\n206.69:  So we're part of the latest space around how somebody has rated notes in the past.\n212.72:  So it's not as simple as left or right, because there are many more life as much\n215.54:  full complex than left or right.\n219.34:  So there's a bunch of correlations in how you rate a community notes posts, community\n225.39:  notes.\n228.48:  So then in order for a community note to actually be shown, people who historically\n234.48:  have disagreed on a subject must agree in order for a note to be shown.\n241.1:  That's the essential magic of it.\n242.98:  I mean, but it's fascinating, because there's a pool of people that have disagreements\n248.74:  and somehow they collaborate through that process of disagreement to come up with.\n253.08:  Yeah, context for two.\n254.2:  Yeah, it's fascinating.\n255.48:  It works.\n255.82:  Yeah, it kind of makes sense that if people who have disagreed agree about something,\n263.18:  it's probably true.\n265.32:  Yeah.\n266.4:  I wonder is there possible somehow emergent thing there that could challenge Wikipedia,\n273.9:  which Wikipedia is a different kind of thing, which is more like permanent articles\n277.96:  about things.\n278.94:  But Wikipedia is very hierarchical whereas community notes is inherently not.\n285.78:  There is no hierarchy.\n287.62:  Like I, and the as a test is, I can't change a community note if I put a gun to my head.\n297.24:  So and any community notes has all the code is open source, 100%.\n304.16:  All the data is open source, 100%.\n307.44:  So you can completely recreate any note in the system independently.\n312.86:  So if there was any interference, you'd notice immediately.",
