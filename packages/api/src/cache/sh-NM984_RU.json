{"transcript": "0.66:  at West Group.\n1.71:  You guys mentioned the Houston Rockets\n4.39:  who are 1-0 as our ball in Denver,\n7.04:  Nuggets.\n8.6:  The maps at 1-1 taken on the\n10.77:  Pelicans who were on 1-0 play tonight,\n13.5:  but not on TNT.\n14.53:  The game you will see later tonight is\n16.94:  the Nuggets and the Clippers,\n19.14:  a Clipper team that has not won on the road\n21.48:  against a Denver team that has not lost at home.\n25.2:  And if you've been keeping score at home,\n28.12:  the Clippers with James Harden in the\n29.58:  Ford O and Ford.\n31.96:  Why is that, Kenny?\n34.06:  I mean, the guy didn't play preseason games.\n36.66:  I mean, I mean, I mean,\n38.43:  I mean, no, my expectation,\n41.44:  I think they could have won 2-1,\n42.9:  1-2, and 1-2, and they have it.\n44.42:  I still are all in Florida.\n47.36:  I don't know if the sample size first of all\n48.7:  was not larger enough to evaluate somebody\n51.04:  after four games.\n52.56:  If I evaluate if the sack after his first\n53.96:  four times, I just show out of\n55.18:  been like, kick them off, right?\n56.38:  But we're not.\n57.17:  We didn't.\n58.48:  We're not going to break the decision now.\n59.98:  You know, so we're not comfortable.\n62.08:  Oh, just when he wasn't hate,\n63.07:  we just don't hate right now.\n64.98:  But no, really, like, it's not a lot of sample size.\n67.98:  James Harden didn't play at all.\n70.34:  It didn't be easy.\n71.22:  Kenny, stop making excuses.\n72.28:  And we evaluate them 20 games in.\n74.98:  And you tell what they are.\n76.98:  A team work or why James can't lose four games at home?\n81.96:  No, they can't.\n82.02:  You never lost four games at a run.\n82.18:  You're the team like Dan Hellmo.\n84.58:  No way.\n84.98:  I want to team every team is lost four games at home.\n87.48:  I don't work too many guys need the ball.\n90.06:  I think you kind of messed with it.\n92.16:  I messed with them.\n92.79:  I messed with them.\n93.86:  I messed with them.\n94.86:  I messed with them.\n95.84:  Oh, games in.\n96.93:  You said he messed with them.\n97.96:  You gave me a stop.\n99.04:  I messed with them.\n99.64:  I messed with them.\n100.28:  You messed with them.\n101.23:  You messed with them.\n101.98:  You see on the grand show.\n103.43:  The question.\n104.17:  You come up to bench.\n105.9:  Somebody's got to come up to bench.\n109.22:  Because you got four guys who are great players\n111.92:  who all need to ball.\n114.28:  That's on the one ball.\n115.94:  I mean, just like this ain't brain surgery.\n118.32:  This is like, okay, somebody's going to have to say,\n121.46:  I said, I'm not going to make a decision until I see them play.\n125.28:  After seeing them play twice, I'm like, man.\n128.98:  Because you just got three other great players standing around watching them like,\n134.7:  you're turned my turn.\n135.8:  That's not how you play.\n136.55:  I'm not really talking about them.\n138.07:  Not as trying to split their time as much as possible.\n143.1:  Not have a lot of overlap and kind of have each of them have their own unit.\n146.7:  Well, it, it, it, it, it that sounds great and theory, but you got it.\n150.92:  You got to figure it out.\n153.5:  Like I say, all of my great players, but there's only one ball.\n158.26:  And I don't look at any one of those guys as great standing shooters.\n163.18:  So they got to play much faster first and foremost.\n166.24:  But we talked about, is anybody going to sacrifice?\n170.58:  Can I ask you something?\n171.28:  Sure.\n172.12:  Later in your career.\n173.98:  Like you weren't even, I don't think you four guys would this probably young at that time.\n178.7:  Yourself, Scotty Pippin, Clyde Drexlin, a key molize one with their Western Conference\n183.7:  Finals, a one shot away from going to the NBA Finals.\n187.2:  You're going to do it differently.\n188.14:  Four ball, four great players.\n190.02:  No, no, not even close.\n191.62:  You think you got four great players like that?\n193.84:  That's not even close.\n194.96:  You got to close to a fair argument because Scotty Pippin was not a great offensive player.\n200.98:  He didn't need to ball.\n202.46:  You think you think right need to ball?\n204.82:  Who?\n205.24:  Russ.\n205.98:  Yes.\n206.98:  Yes.\n207.98:  Hell yes.\n208.98:  There'd be a factor if he does.\n209.98:  And it destates my ground.\n211.05:  That's a coming off the bench because I realized that I suck as a player.\n214.48:  And I went to Rudes and he bring me out to Bentley, Kevin Willis start.\n219.08:  Clyde and a key.\n221.0:  They were our two best players.\n223.14:  But like Russ.\n225.12:  Hell yeah, Russ needs to ball.\n226.64:  I think Russ can affect the game in other way.\n228.5:  He can't talk to rebound.\n229.8:  No, push his pace.\n230.98:  No, that's not his game.\n232.86:  Russ, he balance it and passes a ball.\n235.32:  No, this is good to ball and aggressive to push the pace with the ball.\n238.96:  Either getting into somebody else or score.\n241.34:  I just said to me, Ernie and not enough samples.\n243.96:  Oh, stop.\n245.86:  First of all, he does is not enough samples.\n247.57:  But the players are not going to change.\n249.4:  They still all four need to ball to be effective.\n251.72:  Last time the clippers started a month.\n254.86:  Owen five, March of 2009.\n257.98:  They are on five to start the month of November.\n259.98:  Me and time the Denver nuggets.\n261.7:  The rating champions.\n263.4:  Eight and two.\n265.2:  Chimali, out right now.\n267.21:  Joker is just joking.\n269.35:  Is he just being Joker?\n271.92:  Listen, they're playing well.\n273.82:  They're comfortable.\n275.08:  They have the blueprint.\n276.0:  They know what it takes to win.\n277.34:  Everybody knows their roles.\n278.72:  Understand their roles.\n279.96:  Gordness.\n280.9:  And then just can go.\n283.58:  And everything about being a champion or any of the guys is out.\n286.58:  Somebody makes up.\n287.94:  He's not coming to the Denver.\n289.18:  You don't double those guys.\n291.14:  This is this is LeVocan course.\n292.9:  All the.\n294.5:  It's a nice.\n295.42:  It's a lot.\n295.8:  It's a lot.\n297.26:  It sounds appetizer.\n298.32:  You go.\n299.54:  Listen, that's big man really.\n301.58:  By far.\n301.96:  That's a big far.\n303.2:  No, no, no, no, no, no.\n304.06:  Follow me by the fear.\n304.98:  What?\n306.6:  By far.\n306.96:  By far.\n308.46:  You hear what I said?\n308.86:  By far.\n310.0:  He's a champion.\n311.2:  That's the guy's up.\n312.14:  Okay.\n312.78:  So the championship.\n314.66:  It makes us.\n315.84:  Okay.\n316.7:  Where we said that when we were.\n317.85:  He was.\n319.3:  Yeah.\n319.32:  Way far.\n319.98:  So he.\n321.46:  I mean, listen.\n321.98:  And be as a hell of a play playing.\n322.98:  Playing great.\n324.38:  But I said, when I was in league and I was.\n326.07:  I was good.\n326.98:  But it was you and this dude was.\n328.24:  David Robinson.\n329.78:  Joker is to go.\n331.08:  And a period.\n331.92:  Is it still Serbian.\n334.72:  Slaw.\n335.74:  And not in the Valkyran.\n336.94:  I'll get.\n337.24:  Serbian.\n337.98:  If that's.\n340.96:  Yeah.\n341.96:  Okay.\n341.98:  You know, this is going to be a very.\n343.03:  A time for the nuckers because without your mom Murray, we said coming into the season.\n347.96:  They lost some really good veterans.\n350.44:  Jeff Green.\n351.14:  Bruce.\n352.06:  Bruce growing at Bruce Brown.\n355.32:  The boys are bowing.\n356.56:  Bruce.\n356.73:  No, that's the.\n357.4:  San Antonio.\n357.98:  My bad.\n358.98:  And also Jeff Green.\n360.84:  So we were like saying.\n363.12:  It's.\n363.16:  How does young guys going to come along.\n364.7:  This going to have to speed up the process now.\n366.88:  So this could actually.\n368.34:  It might hurt Denver in the short term.\n370.68:  But in the long term, those guys getting a lot more minutes might be a really positive thing.\n375.24:  Uh.", "segments": [{"timestamp": "0.66", "text": "Introduction and
