{"transcript": "2.58:  Inside the story with 60 minutes correspondent Cecilia Vega.\n8.7:  For six minutes, dude, here we go.\n11.52:  This week on 60 minutes, we are going to the Caribbean nation of Domeneca trying to find sperm whales.\n17.88:  Spurm whales in this part of the world are actually a vulnerable species and they are under threat from everything from noise pollution to plastic that they consume to ship strikes.\n28.56:  Being in the water with sperm whales is a magical experience. There is something spiritual there.\n32.1:  This is more than science and data. This area protects coral reefs.\n36.28:  We went out with Enrique Sala who is a national geographic explorer in residence.\n40.3:  And he is working with the government in Domeneca to try to create a sanctuary to keep these whales safe.\n47.1:  And most people don't know, but there is a treasure here.\n50.48:  They have a resident population of sperm whales.\n53.32:  They do 45 minute dives all the way down to 35 to hunt giants right there.\n59.78:  Normally we see the whales start from one mile offshore.\n64.7:  We go to Domeneca thinking that we are going to be in the water all day every day.\n70.96:  Day one passes.\n72.86:  You guys are pretty quiet.\n74.96:  So you don't hear anything?\n75.61:  No.\n76.84:  Day two passes that we see a male whale in the distance.\n82.88:  Oh, she's standing there running.\n84.24:  Oh, man.\n86.44:  On our final day, can't make this up. Last day, last hour of the trip.\n91.7:  We finally see a whale.\n94.44:  You see the shiny thing on the surface.\n95.96:  That's a sperm whale.\n96.73:  Right here.\n97.86:  And she was absolutely worth the weight.\n100.3:  Not yet.\n103.16:  All right.\n103.38:  Go back to school.\n104.25:  I'm scared.\n104.68:  I can't even see the photographers.\n106.24:  The guys that we were with in that water are really the ones who are making this story.\n110.48:  What it is.\n111.24:  These guys taught me how to be in the water and to not be fearful.\n115.82:  Oh, nice.\n117.28:  You're from out of jail.\n118.05:  I can't find it.\n119.6:  These guys were all about getting the moment with this whale.\n123.4:  I mean, she is swimming right by the camera lens with her mouth wide open.\n127.44:  You can see inside her mouth.\n130.18:  I will confess.\n130.89:  I am neither a snorkeler nor a diver.\n134.48:  I'm an average swimmer.\n137.46:  And she makes a beeline for us.\n140.32:  She is swimming right at us.\n142.0:  Eyes locked on us.\n143.05:  The entire time.\n144.64:  I'm actually kind of panicking at that point because she is massive.\n149.05:  And she's swimming right at us.\n150.69:  And I don't really know how to use these fins.\n152.89:  And I'm trying to kind of back pedal and get out of the way.\n155.34:  But I get really, really do it.\n157.28:  And she swims right by us.\n159.86:  And she circles back around.\n162.4:  And then she poops.\n164.34:  In the ocean.\n165.6:  On the team.\n167.76:  She stayed for about 10 minutes.\n169.9:  And it was both the most terrifying professional experience I think I've had.\n174.3:  And probably the most gratifying and rewarding when it was really something otherworldly.\n181.36:  Three, two, one.\n182.16:  I have learned so much in the last few weeks we've been working on this piece.\n187.06:  Not just about sperm whales.\n188.78:  But about being a correspondent for 60 minutes.\n191.86:  Leslie gave the best advice so far.\n195.28:  She said, remember to have fun.\n197.74:  This is the best job in the world.\n199.74:  And it can get really stressful.\n201.1:  And the deadlines can creep up on you.\n203.04:  But remember to have fun doing it.\n205.68:  I've spent the last 15 plus years covering politics.\n209.65:  I was a White House correspondent for a really long time.\n212.96:  So certainly looking forward to bringing some of that skill here to the show.\n217.09:  But also just to do stories on people to have someone trust you enough to tell you their secrets is not something that will ever be lost on me.\n226.04:  I'm excited to travel more of the world.\n228.68:  I'm excited to sit in the chair and say my name.\n231.6:  I'm 16 minutes, which I haven't set out loud yet.\n233.73:  I'm very nervous about doing that one.\n236.26:  Here we go.\n239.4:  I'm Cecilia Vega.\n241.18:  I'm Cecilia Vega.\n243.32:  I'm Cecilia Vega.\n245.44:  Vega.\n247.34:  Thank you.", "segments": [{"timestamp": "2.58", "text": "Inside the story with 60 minutes correspondent Cecilia Vega."}, {"timestamp": "17.88", "text": "Sperm whales in Dominica are under threat."}, {"timestamp": "36.28", "text": "Creating a sanctuary for sperm whales in Dominica."}, {"timestamp": "53.32", "text": "The resident population of sperm whales in Dominica."}, {"timestamp": "70.96", "text": "Searching for sperm whales in Dominica."}, {"timestamp": "86.44", "text": "Encountering a sperm whale on the final day."}, {"timestamp": "115.82", "text": "The incredible moment with the sperm whale."}, {"timestamp": "181.36", "text": "Reflections on the experience and being a 60 minutes correspondent."}], "videoId": "UFVGlldnpns"}
