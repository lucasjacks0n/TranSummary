{"transcript": "3.24:  Inside the story with Anderson Cooper.\n7.38:  I'm not trying to hold just my family and an institution to account.\n12.2:  It's the British.\n12.86:  Yes, as well.\n13.48:  This week on 60 minutes, I interviewed Prince Harry\n15.66:  for his upcoming book, Spare.\n17.68:  Yeah, of course.\n18.74:  One of the things that interested me about interviewing Prince Harry\n20.94:  is, and frankly reading this book, is that we don't really know who he is.\n26.34:  I've discovered so much through the last two years.\n30.58:  About my own story, me being born into this family,\n34.72:  the sibling rivalry that comes from that, the relationship with the media,\n39.12:  every element of it.\n40.46:  Anybody who's been interested in it all in the Royal Family has watched Prince Harry\n43.52:  grow up from the moment he was born.\n47.52:  Public has a certain perception of all these people that they read about\n50.48:  or they see on television.\n52.4:  And yet the reality of how that person sees themselves and sees their own life\n57.22:  is often very different.\n58.03:  And I find that a really interesting subject.\n62.26:  When I grew to this interview, I obviously had not read the book yet.\n65.86:  But I did not expect there to be such a focus on the early trauma in Harry's life.\n73.2:  One of whom that surprised me and interested me was how the loss of his mother\n79.06:  when he was 12 years old completely altered the course of the rest of his life.\n85.6:  But most people who have lost a parent, all lost a sibling, a young age,\n90.52:  that's, I think, once you've accepted that gun,\n95.72:  then you accept your life is never going to be the same over again.\n99.12:  It changed the person who he was.\n102.84:  And that's something I personally felt sort of understanding of because of losing my dad\n108.22:  when I was 10 years old.\n110.0:  And I didn't realize going into this that that the subject of grief and loss\n115.16:  would be something that was so present in his life for the rest of his life.\n121.28:  Having been through what you've been through now, do you understand your mom differently?\n127.4:  And what's not in a deeper way?\n129.16:  Well, she was going through?\n130.76:  I think one thing I've realized about grief and loss is that once relationship with somebody who's\n135.1:  died continues and your understanding of them actually can change over time,\n140.8:  having been through what you went through with the family, with your wife, the press,\n145.44:  do you understand your mother from a different angle?\n147.9:  Over the years I have understood it more, but yes, certainly as a parent to little kids,\n155.0:  I'm starting to comprehend the position that she was in as a mother, single parent,\n161.0:  trying to look after two boys with this intense media harassment.\n166.46:  It wasn't online then it was very much physical.\n169.26:  She was being chased for the majority of her life when she got together with my father.\n174.34:  She got so much worse after the divorce.\n176.8:  So I've done and continued to do everything I can to make sure that that doesn't happen to my family\n181.78:  because it certainly doesn't seem as though the British press have changed their ways.\n185.14:  You know, I've made peace with losing her,\n188.1:  but I'm now very much focused on turning that pain into purpose.\n193.24:  In the book, Prince Harry talks about the different roles that each of them had, air and spare.\n199.2:  When did you first hear that term the spare?\n205.38:  Probably my earliest memory back is probably when I was a teenager.\n208.24:  You said that you were 20 when you heard the story that your father after your birth set to your mom,\n212.84:  you've given me an air and now a spare my work is done.\n216.12:  That is what has been said.\n218.7:  You can get through.\n220.34:  From the different places that I've heard it, yes.\n226.48:  It may well have been a joke.\n230.24:  But yeah, there was that a term people used in front of you.\n233.6:  It wasn't regularly used by the family in different scenarios,\n237.86:  but there's a general understanding and a feeling that is again projected across the newspapers.\n243.34:  I don't know where William and I would be on a relationship level if the British press weren't involved,\n247.54:  but we would certainly be ahead of a lot closer than we are now.\n249.94:  How does the British press play into your relationship with William?\n254.96:  His life is very much chosen for him, perhaps my life wasn't chosen for me,\n260.46:  but equally I felt like I needed to make something of my life,\n264.4:  so that I didn't end up as a spare spare.\n268.72:  There was an expectation for him, and there was probably an expectation for me,\n274.62:  and certainly from the British press at standpoint,\n277.0:  it was you're the spare.\n278.22:  We can do what I know, but we won't with you.\n280.74:  And you're not allowed to, you're not allowed to.\n281.97:  If you're not allowed to kick back, especially within the family construct that we have.\n287.26:  What would your mom think about what's happened to you and your brother?\n292.74:  I think she'll be sad that it is where it is now,\n298.14:  so I believe that she would want reconciliation,\n302.08:  and I hope that's what's achievable.", "segments": [{"timestamp": "3.24", "text": "Introduction with Anderson Cooper"}, {"timestamp": "15.66", "text": "Discussion on Prince Harry's upcoming book, Spare"}, {"timestamp":
