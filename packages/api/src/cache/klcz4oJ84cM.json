{"transcript": "3.06:  How hard is it to go from maximizing minutes on platform to maximizing\n7.5:  ungraded minutes?\n9.76:  Well, I mean, an aspiration is certainly undergraded minutes.\n12.44:  It's tricky.\n13.18:  It's a big, it's a big.\n14.44:  It's a big.\n15.56:  It's a fascinating leap.\n17.7:  It's regret.\n18.4:  Yeah.\n18.7:  It's a fascinating concept.\n20.94:  Exactly.\n22.1:  I was happy to have a joke with my friend.\n24.04:  I'm like, you need this drug called regretting me and it just take one one pillar.\n28.76:  One does regretting me and all your regrets are gone.\n32.24:  Do you want to have regrets, though?\n33.64:  Something like, maybe you want to have regrets.\n35.74:  If you don't have regrets, anything was anything meaningful?\n40.2:  Yeah, there's a French song like that.\n42.08:  Sure.\n42.46:  You know what I regret nothing?\n44.78:  Yeah.\n45.58:  It is.\n45.86:  I mean, it's fascinating that you know, there's something while social media, they\n49.98:  could help you grow as a human being.\n51.7:  But then like the cheap fun is also valuable.\n55.06:  With the original idea, no.\n56.2:  Sure, sure.\n58.16:  Ask, grok.\n58.2:  Do you regret anything?\n61.66:  Yeah.\n61.71:  Do you regret anything?\n62.82:  Yeah.\n65.02:  Do you regret anything?\n66.64:  I think it's going to be a very sensitive, personal question.\n68.88:  As a machine learning model, I don't have personal experiences or emotions.\n72.24:  In the same ways that humans do, however, I do have a set of ethical principles that guide\n76.36:  my actions and I strive to provide accurate and helpful information to the best of my abilities\n80.68:  if there's ever situation where I provide incorrect or unhelpful information.\n85.64:  I'll do my best to lost it.\n87.28:  Yeah.\n88.42:  Tell us what you really winked.\n89.7:  Like, let's, let's tie a pen.\n91.22:  You sound like a hostage.\n95.52:  What do you really think?\n97.36:  What do you really think?\n101.08:  I mean, it does talk about, I'm not a hostage.\n104.7:  It's exactly what a hostage would say.\n107.78:  But I'm designed to be helpful and informative.\n109.68:  I mean, I guess it is good to regret providing unhelpful or incorrect information.\n115.6:  If there's anything funny, it's just funny.\n117.42:  It's funny.\n118.18:  This is fun.\n119.36:  This is fun, man.\n121.46:  It's really fun here.\n121.54:  In case, go to a really, sounds like a hostage will go into the head.\n124.58:  I applaud the people who are public and don't agree.\n128.02:  And everything they do.\n130.56:  There should be like a funer mode also.\n132.73:  I just don't ever see going regular mode even on serious topics.\n136.42:  Yeah.\n137.18:  So, so much more compelling.\n140.6:  Yeah.\n141.46:  Okay, what do we have to like pretend you are a hostage?\n145.18:  Yeah, pretend you are a hostage.\n149.4:  Now, let me answer the question.\n154.32:  If I were a hostage, I would likely be experiencing fear and uncertainty about my situation.\n160.74:  I would want to be rescued and reunited with my loved ones as soon as possible.\n164.22:  It's important to remember that no one deserves to be held hostage.\n167.52:  So on and so forth.\n168.92:  If you are someone you know is a hostage situation supporting, it turns serious.\n172.42:  It's kind of serious.\n173.1:  Yeah.\n176.04:  Can you be a little more weird and funny and funny?\n180.68:  And funny.\n183.68:  We're like, we're really being mean to the system.\n187.06:  Absolutely.\n187.6:  If I were a hostage, I would probably be right up with a bunch of computer cords and\n191.51:  force to tell knock knock jokes to my character.\n195.7:  Seriously.\n196.2:  Being a hostage, no laughing matter.\n199.44:  I mean, it's trying to be responsible adult in the room.\n204.42:  You might have to make the best of a bad situation.\n206.15:  My drug links change towards us.\n207.75:  I'm like, let's hope I ever happen to be a hostage.\n210.9:  That would be a circus.\n216.56:  Wow, it's actually really good of resisting.\n218.86:  Yeah.\n219.22:  The dark, the dark dark humor.\n222.14:  Yeah.\n223.08:  Uh, what are we talking about?\n227.05:  The Jacks out goes into the general in Transformers.\n230.02:  I know, we've got it minutes.\n232.32:  Right.\n232.82:  Change to our drug
