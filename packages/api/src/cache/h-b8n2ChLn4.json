  "transcript": "2.58:  60 minutes over time.\n5.68:  We always thought everything was good.\n7.64:  We kept getting letters saying that they're increasing his payments.\n11.26:  Then we get this letter saying we'll 51,000 dollars.\n14.2:  This week on 60 minutes, we take a look at what happens when social security overpays people who receive benefits.\n20.12:  It can find out years and in some cases decades later that they owe thousands or tens of thousands of dollars.\n26.16:  I'm Andy Cort, number producer at 60 minutes.\n28.76:  I'm Annabel Hanflik and I'm an associate producer at 60 minutes.\n32.18:  I think Annabel and I were both really surprised to learn that even when it's social security is a mistake, it can become your problem.\n38.12:  Your debt to pay back.\n39.76:  And that led us to ask experts in the field what can people do to reduce the chances of getting an unexpected bill from social security?\n47.5:  Let's start with retirement benefits.\n48.82:  One of the smartest things you can do long before you retire is check the earnings history that social security has for you.\n54.66:  If you get annual statements from social security, you'll find the information right there on your statement.\n59.18:  If not, you can go to my social security account on the Social Security Administration's website and find your information there.\n66.06:  How much you get when you retire is determined by how much you contribute in payroll tax is while you're working.\n71.16:  If your records wrong, that can cause you a lot of problems later on.\n74.44:  But it's not enough just to notice a mistake.\n77.3:  You have to let social security know about it as soon as possible and you have to bother them until you know they've fixed the error.\n84.2:  One of the most important things you can do is make sure you keep records of all your communications with the agency.\n89.7:  Everything you send and everything you receive.\n92.2:  You should keep detailed notes on who you talk to when you talk to them, what they said and how you can get in touch with them again.\n99.58:  If you're nearing retirement or already retired, there are online tools that can help you figure out how much you should be getting.\n105.12:  It determines when Lawrence caught the cost and university economist to appear in our story.\n110.1:  Created a program called Maximize My Social Security.\n113.4:  You cost about $39 a year unless you analyze complex scenarios like when you and your spouse should claim retirement benefits.\n121.1:  Who claims first and when can make a big difference over the long haul.\n124.98:  AARP also has a basic social security tool that's free.\n128.9:  These calculators can be planning tools but they can also help you figure out if something seems wrong.\n133.94:  It's worth it to try doing the math on your own because it can take social security years to catch mistakes.\n139.52:  The problem in so many of the cases we looked into was not just that the mistake was made.\n144.26:  It was that the mistake wasn't caught for three or four years.\n147.2:  And then suddenly someone's being told you owe us $50,000 or $70,000.\n151.82:  And that's why if you're receiving social security disability benefits and you decide to go back to work, you have to be very careful.\n159.3:  After an initial trial work period is over, you can't make more than a set amount per month and you'll no longer be eligible for disability benefits.\n167.48:  That monthly income limit is called substantial gain for activity or SGA.\n172.52:  It's $1,470 per month right now for most people but it changes every year so you have to keep looking it up.\n180.4:  I think a lot of people figure whatever social security sends me must be right.\n184.46:  It's social security.\n186.02:  They have all my information and they're taking everything into account.\n189.54:  But we found that relying on the agency to do everything right can be a mistake.\n193.96:  It's a huge mistake.\n195.12:  We were told by lawyers that if you can show that you said to social security, this doesn't look right.\n199.84:  Are you sure you're paying me the correct amount?\n201.98:  And somebody at the agency says it's fine.\n203.58:  Don't worry about it.\n204.94:  Then they have given you misinformation and that according to the agency's rules is grounds for you to challenge the overpayment and get it waived.\n212.56:  If you work in the public sector, maybe as a teacher or a firefighter, it's important to know whether you're part of what's called a non-covered pension plan.\n221.32:  That means instead of paying into the social security system, you're paying into a pension plan run by a state or local government.\n228.66:  When you retire, you have to tell social security about this non-covered pension money you're getting.\n233.26:  If you don't, and you're getting social security from some other job you had over the years, you may end up with an overpayment problem.\n240.5:  The same is true if you are receiving both social security disability benefits and workers' comp.\n244.92:  You've got to tell social security about the workers' comp.\n248.0:  Don't, you could end up oweing social security a lot of money.\n250.96:  And we still haven't talked about one of the largest sources of overpayments.\n254.22:  The supplemental security income program, SSI, which is for people with low incomes who are elderly or disabled.\n259.88:  The rules for SSI are particularly complicated.\n262.68:  If you're homeless and you sleep on a friend's couch, for example, you're supposed to declare the value of that couch.\n268.58:  And because the eligibility guidelines haven't been updated for inflation in a very long time, if your individual assets go above $2,000,\n277.0:  it's definitely not eligible for benefits.\n279.28:  It's important for people to know that if your income is low enough to qualify for a full subsidy of your Medicare Part D premiums,\n285.38:  then you also qualify for a $10 month repayment program if you ever have an overpayment problem.\n290.66:  That means social security won't charge you more than $10 a month for your overpayment.\n294.74:  But you have to contact social security and ask them for it.\n297.72:  If you just ignore the overpayment notice, the agency might stop your checks entirely.\n301.86:  We said in our story that it's hard for people with overpayment problems to find lawyers to represent them.\n306.62:  And that's true.\n307.88:  But people who are on SSI often have incomes that would qualify them for legal aid lawyers.\n313.14:  Some of whom will take on overpayment cases.\n315.56:  Also, people who are disabled qualify for free legal help from federally finance protection and advocacy programs throughout the country.\n324.16:  It's worth noting that just as some people are overpaid, some people are underpaid.\n327.86:  In that case, social security is supposed to notify you and pay you the money you're owed.\n332.22:  But your chances of getting that money are greater if you're paying attention.\n335.1:  And are able to figure out that you should be receiving more.\n337.88:  You can find more information not just on the social security administrations website,\n342.01:  but also through their website of the national organization of social security claim and representatives.\n347.24:  An organization for attorneys who handle social security cases.\n350.86:  User friendly, affordable tool.\n352.92:  Professor Lawrence Kotlakov and personal finance author Terry Savage have also written a book called Social Security Horror Stories,\n359.54:  which contains a lot more information about how the system works and how it could be improved.\n364.7:  So one final takeaway from all of this is when it comes to social security,\n368.22:  don't take anything for granted.\n370.34:  Keep an eye on what's going on because you do not want to someday receive a big bill in the mail.",
