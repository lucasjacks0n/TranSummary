{"transcript": "0.12:  Is this super weird?\n1.2:  I remember you asked me if I wanted to smoke,\n5.02:  and I can't, I don't really smoke anymore.\n8.28:  And I actually talked for the longest time in my whole life.\n11.88:  I couldn't really explain this.\n14.9:  I couldn't really bring it to words\n20.8:  and try to explain it to where I wasn't like,\n23.42:  where it just was, it made no sense.\n29.04:  But I talked to a couple of my buddies,\n30.72:  and they were like, oh, it's the same thing.\n33.62:  So a lot of my friends from smoking weed,\n36.17:  it's like almost like a de-personalization thing,\n39.2:  to where it feels like for the longest time,\n41.54:  since I had, I smoked one bad joint.\n45.72:  And for the longest time ever since then,\n48.29:  it felt like I've been almost like watching my life happen\n54.18:  instead of actually living it.\n56.04:  Does that make sense?\n57.34:  It does if you had an episode,\n61.1:  like if you smoked one bad joint,\n63.16:  and you got way too high, and you had like a break,\n66.2:  like some sort of a skits of Frank or some sort of strange episode.\n69.82:  And it just feels like a lot of the time,\n71.73:  it's like, it's like, I'm not doing it.\n74.98:  It's like almost is like,\n78.5:  I'm watching it happen.\n79.9:  Still to this day?\n81.14:  To this day, a lot of the time, yeah.\n83.28:  And it happened because of that one thing.\n85.96:  I never felt it in my life before that.\n88.57:  Wow.\n90.06:  So it's like, and I talked to my friends and they,\n95.7:  they were like, oh, that's like a de-personalization.\n98.12:  I don't exactly know what happens or what goes on,\n101.66:  but it's a pretty common thing I feel like for people\n106.9:  who have had a negative experience with like THC or something.\n111.06:  Yeah.\n111.96:  There's, or whatever the fuck was in that joint\n114.24:  that I had in LA that one time.\n115.8:  You know?\n116.72:  Right, you don't know what was in it.\n118.1:  That's true, too.\n118.98:  Maybe it was just fucking LSD or something.\n121.32:  And it totally just like caught me.\n124.81:  But I felt different like to this day,\n127.4:  I still feel different.\n128.18:  That's so weird.\n128.9:  But it could just be THC.\n130.72:  This guy Alex Perkins and wrote a book about it.\n133.1:  It's called Tell Your Children.\n134.8:  And it's about how there's a certain percentage of people\n138.91:  that especially with high dose THC,\n141.86:  they can have a skits of Frank break\n143.96:  or a psychotic break, something goes wrong.\n146.32:  I used to smoke crazy.\n148.46:  I used to smoke a lot like do the volcano,\n150.24:  oh, that shit, that's so fun.\n151.88:  And so one time, one time.\n153.81:  Wow, that's crazy.\n155.7:  One time.\n156.52:  Maybe there was something in it.\n157.99:  How do you pull?\n158.64:  You know, when you're just getting a joint from some dude,\n161.68:  yeah, you don't know the chain of custody, you know?\n163.86:  Yeah, no idea.\n165.04:  Why, where was this cooked up?\n166.46:  No idea.\n167.6:  Ron White was in the green room at the club one night\n170.08:  and he pulled out this joint.\n171.72:  He was this joint call $75.\n174.36:  I think what the fuck is that?\n175.4:  He was got it from Beverly Hills.\n176.56:  I go keep that shit, the fuck away

what the fuck you're talking about.\n188.16:  He was like, what did you do to me?\n190.2:  The fuck, I thought it was weed.\n192.08:  But they've got these joints now\n193.41:  and these crazy dispensaries like in LA,\n196.74:  whether it's legal now.\n197.82:  So they're lacing them with THC.\n200.32:  They got THC crystals in them crazy.\n202.44:  In them and yeah.\n203.72:  These are not regular joints.\n206.1:  These are for dudes like be real,\n209.48:  like the kind of shit that he's most.\n211.26:  You know?\n212.78:  Be real real real real.\n213.64:  This is not to my
