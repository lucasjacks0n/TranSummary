  "transcript": "2.28:  60 minutes over time.\n6.78:  There are roughly 1,800 monkeys on Kiyosantiago off the coast of Puerto Rico.\n14.78:  They live in isolation and what is a natural laboratory.\n20.2:  Their recessed Maccat monkeys who have been studied there for over 80 years because 94%\n27.2:  of their DNA is the same as humans.\n32.74:  Everything changed for the research and the monkeys when Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico\n39.38:  in September 2017.\n42.32:  You thought the monkeys were all going to die.\n44.58:  We thought that the monkeys were going to die.\n47.1:  Angelina Ruizlambeides, the then scientific director of Kiyosan, seven months pregnant\n53.29:  at the time.\n54.96:  She entered in her home outside of San Juan with her husband and to young children.\n60.64:  It sounded like a screaming woman's voice, constantly for 19 hours.\n66.63:  I was locked in one room that was the safest place in our home.\n73.3:  Our windows got sucked out from the second floor and we had the hurricane literally inside\n78.85:  of our home two hours in.\n81.28:  Water just dripping through the concrete ceiling.\n85.52:  We went upstairs and our entire second floor was flooded and we're trying to take water\n90.63:  out and I fall two times.\n93.06:  You know, pregnant.\n93.56:  It was so stressful.\n95.84:  You just keep thinking, whoever is living in front of the ocean.\n101.48:  My staff, they must be dead.\n103.9:  That's what I was thinking.\n105.74:  155 mile an hour winds smashed into homes and office buildings, destroying everything\n112.78:  inside, including the power grid and communication systems.\n117.64:  Nearly 3,000 people died.\n120.46:  Two days after the hurricane I get a message, a text message saying, we have booked a helicopter.\n128.84:  Can you make it?\n129.47:  Can you be there Sunday morning?\n132.7:  And I wrote back I said yes on it.\n135.16:  So I start flying over the island and seeing so many homes destroyed.\n142.32:  It looked like a bomb had dropped on the island.\n147.06:  I asked the pilot to please fly over our office building and around it, lived our neighbors.\n157.18:  Like 70, something year old, neighbors, home was destroyed.\n162.48:  I could see him every day from my office window and I would imagine he was dead.\n167.78:  And sorry.\n169.88:  Wow.\n171.26:  A couple steps away from my office.\n173.88:  There was written with white paint on the street.\n177.48:  SOS, Nessasidamos, agua, igomita.\n181.94:  So SOS, we need water and food.\n185.36:  Oh my God.\n187.1:  And whoa, that was really, really hard because it's my people.\n196.54:  We then went straight to Caius, Santiago where the monkeys are.\n200.24:  And I see this destruction, like 80 plus years of work completely flattened.\n209.64:  Angelina was horrified.\n212.8:  This is footage she shot from the helicopter.\n219.68:  This is Caius before the hurricane, with a dense canopy of trees and lush foliage.\n226.52:  This is after, a green oasis turned brown, buried in dead branches.\n233.78:  The island lost two thirds of its vegetation.\n237.86:  Broken by what she was seeing from the air.\n240.8:  Angelina wanted a closer look.\n243.28:  But even on the ground, she didn't see any monkeys.\n247.34:  So then I get on the helicopter again.\n249.68:  And I got the gun.\n252.62:  And that's when I see a social group running from the helicopter.\n257.56:  And second, there's monkeys.\n259.16:  There's still Caius.\n261.62:  Once the staff was able to return and do a complete census on the ground,\n266.8:  they found to their utter astonishment that most had lived.\n272.36:  They estimated just about 50 had died.\n275.7:  What about all the samples you had taken in the past?\n279.68:  The office building of the primate center in Punta Santiago was without power for nine months.\n287.44:  Nine months.\n287.99:  And we have, in our minus 80 freezers and in our freezers,\n292.36:  we have biological samples and like serum from monkeys for years and years.\n300.24:  And we owe it to the staff.\n302.52:  They would come in the middle of the night to inspect the generators to make sure that they\n306.55:  would turn off.\n307.35:  And if we had an emergency, then we had a backup for the freezers specifically.\n313.0:  And we did not lose a single sample.\n315.54:  You have said that the staff and many other people on the island\n322.06:  feel as though they're still living through Maria.\n325.16:  That is true because our infrastructure hasn't been rebuilt.\n328.82:  Because there are still houses with blue tarps.\n333.1:  There are still bridges that connected communities that have been rebuilt.\n337.98:  And hurricane season approaches were just not necessarily ready and safe yet.\n343.69:  Hundreds of thousands of people left Puerto Rico after the hurricane just moved away.\n350.84:  Yeah, but why didn't you?\n352.7:  I didn't leave because how is needed here.\n355.06:  There's still a lot of work to do here.\n357.56:  I'm not.",
