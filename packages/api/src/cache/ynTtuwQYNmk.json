{"transcript": "1.28:  Hey, I'm trying to Miller.\n2.62:  I'm here to talk to you about a fly phone in the way iPhone handles code signing.\n7.22:  So, goes to how important is because that's the way that the iPhone protects you from\n11.77:  malware.\n12.42:  So, all the apps that you have on your phone have to go through the app store and the app\n17.24:  store they have a chance to check it, make sure it doesn't do anything bad.\n20.32:  And then when you're app, the apps you download from there you can trust our safe because\n24.59:  apples look at them and they can't change what they do or do anything different.\n29.28:  The fly phone allows apps to enter an app store to download new code and run it even if\n34.04:  it's not signed and even if it hasn't been checked by Apple.\n38.16:  So, you can imagine downloading an ice app like Angry Birds but instead of just being\n42.64:  Angry Birds is actually a download and do anything in once an Apple would have no idea\n46.67:  it would happen.\n47.88:  So, let's take a look and see how this works.\n52.64:  So the first thing we have to do is download the app from the app store.\n57.44:  This app is a stock market app that I wrote that first thing it does is it checks in\n64.92:  with an attacker server and it seems there's any code it should download and run.\n69.46:  So here we've installed it much running.\n73.36:  So, this first time we run it it checks in but there's nothing for it to download and\n77.79:  install.\n78.3:  So, it runs just like it was supposed to and this is exactly the experience that the people\n85.52:  of the Apple store got when they were reviewing it.\n90.02:  So it doesn't do anything weird or funny.\n93.16:  It just shows you this stock so you can see here that it was checking in for the library\n99.28:  to download and run but there was nothing.\n101.42:  So let's try it again.\n102.7:  But this time we're going to replace we're going to set some code therefore to download\n106.4:  and run.\n107.18:  Remember, this is code that is unsigned.\n110.58:  Apple's never had a chance to review it.\n114.2:  And yet it's going to run on this iPhone.\n118.28:  So let's download and install it again.\n121.48:  I only checked for the payload when he first ran it for the very first time.\n126.72:  So this time we run it and as you can see something different happens in the last time.\n131.72:  So again, this is code that was not reviewed and it could have done anything.\n141.4:  And so it gets around the processes built into the App Store to stop this.\n150.4:  So here's another payload I have that the app can download and run and this one's a\n155.69:  little worse and something Apple didn't have a chance to review and they definitely wouldn't\n162.08:  have a proof that they would have seen it.\n164.92:  So here again we're going to download the app from the App Store and install.\n175.6:  And then you'll notice that when I ran it it opened up a shell on the attacker system\n181.5:  that allows the attacker to do whatever they want.\n186.78:  So here's some directory listing process listing.\n190.72:  You can even do physical things with the phone.\n193.38:  I can make it vibrate and as you can see the user doesn't know anything is going on.\n197.52:  This looks like the normal app.\n201.4:  I can grab a file I want.\n205.82:  So here is for example the address book I can download.\n218.92:  So just download the header book.\n219.99:  So you can see it's pretty to payload that shouldn't be logged around the iPhone.\n225.4:  So it shows the malware can run the iPhone with this flaw and Apple is going to fix this\n231.26:  flaw and then we back into case where it will be pre-protected because of the App Store.\n237.26:
