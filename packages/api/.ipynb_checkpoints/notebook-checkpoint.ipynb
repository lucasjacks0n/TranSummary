       "\"0.06:  One thing that is known for is version control.\\n2.32:  In fact, there will be for some people\\n3.77:  the first way that describe it.\\n4.81:  I described, get as protecting code.\\n7.28:  But you could describe it as protecting versions as well.\\n12.26:  Versions is a thing which drives me insane.\\n14.2:  When you come and you find somebody's called a video.\\n17.06:  Dot final or underscore final,\\n19.04:  because you just know there's going to be a change to it.\\n21.24:  And there'll be final final or new final,\\n24.16:  final, new final.\\n25.34:  What what does get to?\\n26.9:  It's good to think about things like that\\n28.44:  because you would end up with software in the same.\\n30.22:  And I had a friend in the company\\n31.6:  and they were producing versions of software.\\n33.46:  And someone wasn't conforming to the company's style\\n35.81:  of naming things and was creating new version for.\\n38.4:  Dot new.\\n39.56:  You know, all these things.\\n41.52:  But yeah, so actually software has a pretty strong history\\n43.73:  of having a version number of schemes.\\n45.26:  For example, if you look at the latest version of Chrome or Chrome\\n47.34:  and it's like version 98.0.4758.81.\\n52.86:  That's time of recording.\\n54.08:  At the time of recording.\\n56.24:  Or that might be the current version I've been stored,\\n57.88:  which is when I last updated it for still.\\n59.84:  Like this is the source that version 9 takes the major one.\\n62.8:  And then 0.0 is the latest minor iteration of it.\\n66.34:  And then 0.4758 is the latest patch to it.\\n70.78:  But what they're doing at the same time\\n73.32:  is they're maintaining older versions.\\n75.0:  So you can at any time if you want to.\\n76.87:  You could install version 94 of Chrome.\\n79.37:  Just by going to their open source community\\n82.86:  and then downloading an old version.\\n85.26:  And if you really want, you can have\\n86.62:  it's quencheding with programming.\\n87.35:  You can see the latest commit that a developer has put\\n90.1:  into the Chrome repository.\\n91.46:  And you can download that, whether it works or not,\\n93.67:  as the developer, you can download it.\\n96.12:  But the point is that they've created these versions\\n98.88:  and they're using Git to manage this version history.\\n101.92:  And they are using what's called branches within Git\\n106.03:  to manage old versions that they need to update.\\n108.79:  So there might be like a patch to an old version,\\n111.33:  which has new features.\\n112.51:  It doesn't have certain new features of a new one.\\n114.44:  But someone's using because it's compatible\\n115.96:  with something else.\\n116.64:  But it still needs a security fix.\\n118.02:  Absolutely.\\n118.84:  So whenever they find the vulnerability,\\n120.26:  they say, OK, we need to update, you know, like Windows 8.\\n123.46:  If anybody still isn't that mean to make sure that's secure.\\n125.98:  So they've got to somehow go back to download the code\\n128.64:  for Windows 8.\\n129.6:  Make that patch to it and then release probably 8.10.75,\\n133.84:  which is the latest patch to it.\\n135.22:  And you can see this when you get new release notes.\\n137.64:  You know, if you're on your phone and like Netflix updates\\n140.15:  to the latest version, you get these release notes\\n142.4:  saying version 17.5.8 has these things fixed.\\n147.32:  And it will have like a little description\\n148.55:  of what the update is.\\n150.08:  But what they do is they have these kind of past versions\\n152.22:  built into what's called a Git branch.\\n154.28:  So that branch then can then exist forever.\\n156.82:  And you can then switch your code view to that branch\\n160.46:  in the history and say, I want to update, you know,\\n163.54:  version 16, because they're still using it with this fix.\\n167.66:  And then commit to that and they're OK.\\n170.04:  Let's check out the main branch again\\n171.66:  and we'll make updates to the main branch,\\n173.03:  which is what our main job is.\\n175.4:  So you find companies use these kind of product release branches\\n179.46:  essentially to store long term in parallel\\n182.38:  with the current new updates and then what other versions\\n184.91:  they can update.\\n186.42:  So in the first video we did,\\n187.5:  we talked about GitHub having like a linear history\\n189.96:  of all your past versions.\\n192.4:  At some point you can say, OK, I want to branch\\n194.4:  that the new history into a tree.\\n196.84:  And you can switch between those trees, essentially,\\n199.62:  using the Git branch command.\\n201.58:  One thing you can do first is you can type in just\\n203.62:  Git branch and it will list all the things you have.\\n206.65:  And for most people, if they've never created branch before,\\n208.9:  that just shows you the main branch that you're currently on\\n211.05:  and it will have a star next to it,\\n213.12:  because that's the one that's showing you.\\n215.32:  If you wanted to create a new branch, which is like\\n219.02:  for developing a new feature, for example,\\n221.38:  you could type Git branch and then have a name.\\n224.5:  And that will create a new branch from your current points\\n228.3:  and then it will be listed if you type Git branch again,\\n230.49:  there's being one of the branches you could switch to.\\n233.08:  Do you call that one new or final?\\n234.77:  Yeah, new branch.\\n236.54:  So actually, that's a really complicated issue,\\n239.94:  because teams that are working on codes,\\n241.42:  there might be 100 developers and they all might need\\n243.24:  to create a temporary branch.\\n244.66:  So they've got to have some sort of naming scheme.\\n245.99:  So it's a good point to make why they're there.\\n251.46:  But so if you then want to work on that branch,\\n254.04:  then you have to get check out that branch.\\n256.76:  So you have to kind of choose to switch your view\\n259.5:  from the main branch and then say,\\n261.78:  okay, now I want to view this new branch,\\n264.74:  which you might name new,\\n265.8:  it could be called Dev branch.\\n268.06:  And then what that would do is it will change\\n270.24:  your folder view, which I've mentioned before,\\n272.52:  to show in the files that are in that branch.\\n274.62:  So that means you could then add some new files in that branch,\\n277.12:  you could then commit them to that branch.\\n279.48:  Then if you get check out the main,\\n281.38:  you'll see those files disappear temporarily.\\n283.84:  Although there's stored somewhere in your doc Git folder,\\n285.49:  it's compressed objects.\\n286.3:  You've chosen to view the main branch,\\n289.12:  and so it will hide all the ones that aren't related to the main branch.\\n291.64:  And then when you get check out the Dev branch,\\n294.46:  it will then bring those files back to you and show them to you.\\n297.04:  So it's a kind of handy way of switching between version and specifying.\\n300.6:  So that means these companies that have created\\n303.8:  like a version for .45 of their software,\\n307.92:  they can, if they ever want to switch to it,\\n309.38:  they check out branch version .45\\n313.54:  and then they could work on it and then see those files,\\n315.78:  and they can check out the main again,\\n317.72:  or whichever one they're supposed to normally work on.\\n319.8:  We can also talk about Git tag.\\n321.98:  So Git tag is kind of a handy feature where you can name\\n326.08:  a point in your history with a friendly name.\\n329.52:  So instead of saying I want to check out this hash code\\n333.32:  of like a past commit, you can say,\\n335.67:  okay, there was one point in time,\\n337.13:  which is when we finished version .45,\\n340.42:  and we can give that a friendly name,\\n342.18:  so that if I ever want to, I can say,\\n343.17:  Git checkout .45 and it will just download .45 for me.\\n346.88:  So it's a way of giving things friendly names you can use.\\n349.74:  A lot of companies use like a B in the name of scheme for beta,\\n352.58:  or RC from release candidate,\\n354.26:  which is when they think that this,\\n356.66:  the updates this branch are almost ready to show to the public.\\n360.14:  And then they will show them to a certain outlet\\n362.36:  of potential users who test things as a release candidate.\\n366.7:  And then they will so they'll name it,\\n368.02:  they'll get to tag it with that release candidate ID\\n370.72:  so that they can then share a specific friendly name diversion\\n374.38:  with people to download.\\n375.94:  And companies will have all sorts of automation scripts,\\n378.22:  which will take anything that's given a Git tag\\n380.76:  and compile it as a ready to ship product\\n383.68:  and test it on a server and then deploy it to a point where\\n386.56:  people can download it and automatically update the website\\n388.63:  to say there's a new version.\\n390.06:  You could build other things in,\\n391.36:  but in practice, the fact that they're named\\n394.01:  with Git tag as a command is what's important.\\n398.04:  So what happens is when you first create a file,\\n400.4:  the create file in there, make my files green,\\n402.38:  just represent this box and I call that version one.\\n404.64:  So at this point, Git doesn't know anything about that\\n406.19:  because you haven't told it about it.\\n407.26:  So to get to know about it, we have to do this.\\n409.96:  And I think Mike's going to demonstrate this in a second\\n412.98:  is that log for a j's like milk, he's like water.\\n416.24:  It's everywhere.\""
